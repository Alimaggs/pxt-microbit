Have you ever tried to making your plant to be interacative? Let's try making a soil moisture sensor!

Soil moisture sensors work by measuring the level of current flowing between two electrodes immersed in soil. Students can investigate and develop their own
moisture sensor using common materials such as aluminium foil, metal roads, insulating tape, foam blocks, insulated wire etc. They can be tested before use by
attaching a bulb and cell, checking that the bulb lights up when the electrodes are inserted into damp soil.

The moisture sensor is then attached
to the micro:bit edge connector with
crocodile clips.
